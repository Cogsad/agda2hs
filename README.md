## agda2hs

Compiles a subset of Agda to readable Haskell code.
Use case: writing your code in Agda rather than in Haskell,
to verify some of its properties.
The run `agda2hs` to translate it to Haskell.

See test/Test.agda for an example.

### Future work

- [ ] Literals in patterns
- [ ] Map instance arguments to Haskell type classes (definitions and use) [#3](https://github.com/agda/agda2hs/pull/3)
- [ ] `where` clauses
- [ ] Higher-rank polymorphism
- [ ] Strings (compile to `Data.Text`)
- [ ] Compile `case_of_ Î» where` to Haskell `case`
- [ ] `with`?
- [ ] Compile equality proofs to QuickCheck properties?
- [ ] Module export lists (how?)
- [ ] Fixity declarations
